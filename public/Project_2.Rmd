The msqR dataset is a large dataset containing the MSQ (Motivational State Questionnaire) scores of various participants to study emotions. A subset of this data includes an experiment where participants where given caffeine or a placebo drug and their various emotions where then scored using the MSQ. When the variable drug is 0, the participant received a placebo; when drug equals 1 the participant received caffeine. After taking caffeine, the participants' various emotions and states were recorded. The Extraversion, Neuroticism, Lie and Sociability variables are from the EPI test that participants took rating their personality traits. I removed the film column because I only wanted to look at the experiment with caffeine; the film variable corresponds to the experiment where participants watched a particular film and had their emotions evaluated after.

```{r}

man1<-manova(cbind(Extraversion,Neuroticism,Lie,Sociability,Impulsivity,active,afraid,angry,relaxed,happy)~gender, data=msqR)

```
*The manova results are significant as the p-value is 0.01204. When doing the univarate ANOVA, only Impulsivity signficantly differed between the two genders before doing the bonferroni adjustment. A total of 11 tests where done. Probability of getting at least one type 1 error is 43.12%. The significance level should be 0.004545455 after correcting. The difference in Impulsivity is not significant anymore. The assumptions for MANOVA are homogeneity of within-group covariance matrices and multivariate normality of dependent variables. These assumptions are probably not meet in this dataset. *

```{r}

m_a<-mean(msqR[msqR$gender=="female",]$sorry)-mean(msqR[msqR$gender=="male",]$sorry)

rand_dist <-vector()

for(i in 1:5000) {
  new <-data.frame(sorry =sample(msqR$sorry), gender = msqR$gender)
  rand_dist[i] <-mean(new[new$gender=="female", ]$sorry)- mean(new[new$gender=="male", ]$sorry)
}
hist(rand_dist,breaks=20, abline=0.59)

mean(rand_dist>m_a)*2 

```

*The null hypothesis is that sorry's mean values does not significantly differ between females and males. The alternative hypothesis is that the difference between sorry's mean value does significantly differ between the two genders. Since the p-value>0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected; the difference between the mean sorry scores betweeen the two genders is not significant.*

*A female who scored 0 on tense and 0 on nervous would have a Neuroticism score of 9.8049. For every 1 increase in tense, the Neuroticism score decreases by 0.6414 on average for females with a 0 nervous score. For every 1 increase in nervous, the Neuroticism score increases by 1.2326 on average for females with a 0 tense score. Males with 0 tense and 0 nervous scores have average Neuroticism scores less than females by 1.6333. Males with 0 nervous score have a slope of tense score on Neuroticism score that is 3.7337 more than females. Males with 0 tense scores have a slope of nervous score on Neuroticism score that is 4.3815 less than females.*

*The linearity and normality assumptions are violated. The homoskedasticity is not violated. The regression results using the robust standard errors are the same as the homoskedasticity was not violated. The adjusted R-squared is 0.09358 so only 0.09358 of the data is explained by the model.*

*Every one-unit increase in jittery multiplies odds of receiving the caffeine by 2.162. Every one-unit increase in alert multiplies odds by 0.925. Every one-unit increase in aroused multiplies odds by 1.079. Every one-unit increase in sluggish multiplies odds by 0.475. Every one-unit increase in wakeful multiplies odds by 1.521.*

*Accuracy=0.757, Sensitivity(TPR)=0.783, Specificity(TNR)=0.727, Recall(PPV)=0.758*

*The AUC is 0.800. Since the AUC is between .7 and .8, the model is fair at predicting if the participant had caffeine.*

*The accuracy is 0.716, sensitivity is 0.780, and recall is 0.736, after performing the 10-fold CV. The AUC is now 0.756.*

*Only jittery, sleepy, sluggish, and wakeful were retained after doing LASSO. The AUC of the 10 fold CV is 0.765. The accuracy of this model using LASSO is 0.698. In part 5, the accuracy was 0.716, so using LASSO decreased the out of sample accuracy.*
