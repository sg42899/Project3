      <description>These datasets were taken from the Internet. Two datasets were used: one includes data about the Bechdel test score of each movie, while the other includes information about the top 250 movies on IMDB. The USboxOfficeInf variable is the US box office total that has been inflated to the current 2019 value. The dataset of the IMDB movies was found on the website data.world. I choose these two datasets because I like movies a lot and was curious to see how the top 250 movies ranked on the Bechdel test.</description>
